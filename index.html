            I have gained experience in web development through coursework and
            personal projects. I am efficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            familiar with frameworks such as React and Angualar. I have also
            worked with database and web servers, and have experience with git
            version control.

            Additionally, I am a quick learner and am always eager to pick up
            new skills and technologies. I am confident that my skills and
            passion for web development make me strong candidate. I am excited
            about the opportunity to work alongside experienced professionals
